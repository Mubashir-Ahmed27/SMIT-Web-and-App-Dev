        <h1>About Allah's Mercy (Rahmah)</h1>
        <p>Imagine how the rain falls - soft, steady, <br>
          healing. It touches dry earth and brings life
          where everything once seemed still. A few
          drops, and suddenly, green returns.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          Now think about our lives. What if Allah's
          mercy touched us like that rain? What
          sorrows would ease? What joy would return? <br>
          What part of us would come back to life? <br>
          Let's never stop asking Allah for His Rahmah. <br>
          Here is a Dua of the Prophet (peace be upon
          him) asking for Allah's mercy.
        </div>

          <h2>Dua for Mercy</h2>
          <blockquote><strong>أَضْلِحْ عَيْنٍ، طَرْفَةَ نَفْسِي إِلَى تَكِلْنِي فَلَا أَزْجُو،
              رَحْمَتَكَ اللَّهُمَّ
              كُلَّهُ شَأْنِي لِي <br>

              <q>O Allah, Your mercy is what I hope for, so do not leave me to myself for even the blink of
                an eye, and make all of my affairs well.</q></strong></blockquote>
